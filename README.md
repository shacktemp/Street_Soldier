# Street_Soldier
The objective of this project is to explore the relationship between veterans receiving benefits and the homeless populations in county in the United States.  I will be using data from the https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/fy-2020-disability-compensation-recipients-by-county and https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/3031/pit-and-hic-data-since-2007/.
