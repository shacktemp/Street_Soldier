# Street_Soldier
The objective of this project is to explore the relationship between veterans receiving benefits and the homeless populations in counties of the United States.  I will be using data from the https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/fy-2020-disability-compensation-recipients-by-county and https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/3031/pit-and-hic-data-since-2007/.												


## Accessing the Program and Packages Needed be Installed
Find the the project notebook above, street_soldier.ipynb, and run it in Google Colab. The program uses pandas and matplotlib to perform an analysis of the two mentioned data sets. It will read in, clean, and rearrange the data as needed using python commands and pandas. It will execute data visualization using matplotlib.			

## Features
1. Read in two CSVs
2. Clean data and perform a pandas merge.  Calculate the ratio of total homelessness as compared to the VA benefit recipients for a given county.
3.  Use matplotlib to make 3 charts.  A pie chart to show the relationship of veterans by their claim status. A bar chart to compare homelessness in different counties. A scatterplot to display whatever overlap between homelessness and VA benefit recipients exist.  
4. Build a data dictionary that list variables and their parameters used. It will be included in the README file.
5. Ensure that the notebook and the README are detailed with limited to no errors (grammar, organization).
